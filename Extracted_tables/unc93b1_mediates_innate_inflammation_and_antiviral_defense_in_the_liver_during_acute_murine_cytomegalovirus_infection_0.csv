aData presented represent,,the mean 6 SD of,,two liver sections unless otherwise indicated.,,,,
bNumber of,,foci per 8650 mm2 areas in day 5 infected 3d livers was significantly higher,,,than WT at,"the same infection time point, p#0.04.",,
,CNucleated cells from large areas of,,"inflammation contained .60 nucleated cells in less defined foci, and do not",,,,include a calculation of SD.,
