The call,rate is the percentage of bases determined by the resequencing algorithm. Time ranges indicate the oldest,,,,,isolate with high homology provided by the,
BLASTN algorithm and the most,,recent one. The medians were calculated based upon the sequences showing the highest alignment scores.,,,,,
