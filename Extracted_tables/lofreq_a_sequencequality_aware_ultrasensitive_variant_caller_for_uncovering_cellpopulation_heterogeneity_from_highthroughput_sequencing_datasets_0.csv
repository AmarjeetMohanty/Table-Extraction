,Sensitivity and PPV are reported as an average of 10 replicates. Sensitivity was measured as the fraction of,,,,,true SNVs that were correctly called and,,
PPV was measured as,the,"fraction of SNV calls
that were",correct.,"In all
cases,",standard deviation was <2%. We present,,results,for Breseqâ€™s
stand-alone variant caller,,(indicated with Breseq*),in this comparison as,,the Breseq pipeline unexpectedly performed poorly on this dataset.,,,
