,Three categories were incorporated to cross-validate the model: either type 1;,,type 2; or neither. Clinical,isolates were treated as an unknown class and
,"cross-validated sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and class error were based on their classiﬁcation prediction score as neither type 1 or type 2 reference control",,,
strains (i.e. category 3).,,,,
