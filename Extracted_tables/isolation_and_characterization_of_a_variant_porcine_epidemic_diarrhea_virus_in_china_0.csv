Twelve pairs of oligonucleotide primers were used to amp-,,"pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa, Japan) and sequenced using an",
lify the different regions of,"the CHGD-01 genomes, and",automated genome sequence (Genetic Analyzer 3730XL;,
were designed based on the,sequences of PEDV strain,"Applied Biosystems, USA). The terminal sequences were",
CV777. The PCR products were purified and cloned into,,acquired using a kit for rapid amplification of cDNA ends,
